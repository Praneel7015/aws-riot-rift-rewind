If you are reading this my n8n AI Automation has successfully ran. I have successfully made my n8n Ai Automation run and it is now able to make md files for me and save it to my github without me even having to open my github, everything is now automated and i dont even have to worry about it not reaching my website due to AWS AMplify taking care of it for me! and everything seems to be running smoothly!

Thanks for Reading!
