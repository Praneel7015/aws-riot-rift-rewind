An animated, gaming-themed personal landing page built with the Next.js Pages Router. It features neon-inspired visual effects, a featured game library, and an about pageâ€”all statically generated for fast loads.

- **Featured game showcase** â€“ Steam header art rendered with `next/image`, ready for quick curation.
- **Quick navigation hub** â€“ Prominent profile links, social icons, and a dedicated about page.
- **Static generation by default** â€“ Home (`/`) and About (`/about`) routes pre-rendered on build.
- **Optional Umami analytics** â€“ Drop in environment variables to enable privacy-friendly tracking.
