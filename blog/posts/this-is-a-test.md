If you are seeing this, I have successfully made my n8n AI Automation run and it is now able to make Markdown files for me and save it to my GitHub without me even having to open my GitHub. Everything is now automated, and I don't even have to worry about it not reaching my website due to AWS Amplify taking care of it for me! Everything seems to be running smoothly!

Thanks for Reading!
