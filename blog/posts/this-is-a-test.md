I have successfully made my n8n AI Automation run, and it is now able to create Markdown files for me and save them directly to my GitHub repository without me even having to open GitHub! Everything is now fully automated, and I don't even have to worry about the content not reaching my website, thanks to AWS Amplify taking care of the deployment for me. Everything seems to be running smoothly!

Thanks for Reading!
