I will now be using this site as my website content and will host it on AWS!

Right now, this site runs on Next.js and is hosted on Vercel. As part of the challenge, I’ll improve the design, performance and developer experience! and make the project even more open‑source‑friendly.

What’s next:
- Move hosting to AWS
- Shifting and Adjusting
- Improve performance, accessibility accross devices, and maybe SEO
- Tidy-up documentaion

Stay tuned for updates.
