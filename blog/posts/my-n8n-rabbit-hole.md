Welcome to my new obsession: the n8n automation rabbit hole!
I have successfully implemented my n8n AI automation, and now I want to share how I did it.

I wanted something that would automate my blog-making process because who wants to manually type `git add .`, then `git commit`, then `git push`? I want it all to be done for me!
Since I wanted to type out my messages in Discord, I am using Discord nodes. For the trigger, I am using [n8n-nodes-discord-trigger](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-discord-trigger), which is such a lifesaver. It saved me such big headaches, I can't explain how grateful I am. Shout-out to [katerlol](https://www.npmjs.com/package/n8n-nodes-discord-trigger) â€“ you saved my ass, man.

Thanks for Reading!
